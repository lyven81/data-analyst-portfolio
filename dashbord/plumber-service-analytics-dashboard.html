        <section class="overview">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>A home services plumbing company with 10 technicians was struggling to track performance and identify quality issues. Despite having a CRM system, they had no visibility into key operational metrics like technician utilization, callback rates, or weekly trends. Management relied on gut feel rather than data, missing opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce costly rework.</p>

          <p><strong>The Business Challenge:</strong> How can a small plumbing business gain operational visibility without hiring a dedicated analyst or spending hours on manual reporting?</p>

          <p><strong>Project Goal:</strong> Build a repeatable productivity analytics system that tracks company-wide and individual technician performance, identifies quality issues (callbacks), and supports weekly decision-making—all with minimal manual intervention.</p>

          <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python (Pandas, NumPy), Google Looker Studio, CSV data processing, Business logic design</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 1: The Business Problem -->
        <section class="analysis-section">
          <h2>1. Who Has the Business Problem?</h2>
          <img alt="Business problem overview" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/dashbord/images/business-problem.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;"/>

          <p><strong>The Client:</strong> A plumbing services company managing 10 field technicians handling 200-300 jobs per month across service, repair, and installation work.</p>

          <p><strong>Pain Points Identified:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No visibility into productivity:</strong> Management couldn't see which technicians were efficient vs. underperforming</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden quality issues:</strong> Callbacks (repeat visits for the same problem) weren't tracked, costing thousands in unpaid rework</li>
            <li><strong>Time-consuming manual reporting:</strong> Pulling basic metrics required hours of Excel work each week</li>
            <li><strong>Gut-feel decisions:</strong> Technician performance reviews and job assignments based on perception, not data</li>
            <li><strong>No trend analysis:</strong> Unable to see if business performance was improving or declining week-over-week</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Low utilization (technicians spending too much time on non-billable activities), undetected quality issues leading to customer dissatisfaction, and lack of data-driven coaching opportunities meant leaving $30,000+ in potential annual revenue on the table.</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>Key Business Need:</h3>
            <p>Transform raw CRM exports into a weekly dashboard that shows: (1) company-wide utilization and revenue trends, (2) individual technician performance and quality metrics, and (3) early warning indicators for quality issues—with zero manual data entry.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: How Dashboard Solves - Visibility -->
        <section class="analysis-section">
          <h2>2. Solution: Company-Wide Performance Visibility</h2>
          <img alt="Company overview dashboard page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/dashbord/images/company-overview-mockup.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;"/>

          <p>The <strong>Company Overview</strong> dashboard page provides at-a-glance performance metrics that management can review in under 2 minutes:</p>

          <p><strong>Top-Line Metrics (Scorecards):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Revenue:</strong> $89,192 (June 2024) — immediate visibility into monthly income</li>
            <li><strong>Total Jobs Completed:</strong> 225 jobs — volume tracking to correlate with marketing efforts</li>
            <li><strong>Average Utilization:</strong> 71.6% — showing 71.6% of paid technician time generates billable revenue (target: 70-85%)</li>
            <li><strong>Callback Rate:</strong> 6.7% — quality indicator showing 15 jobs required return visits (target: <5%)</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Revenue Breakdown by Job Type:</strong> Pie chart showing service ($33,988), repair ($33,851), and install ($21,354) work—revealing that 38% of revenue comes from each service/repair, with only 24% from higher-margin installations.</p>

          <p><strong>Time Allocation Analysis:</strong> Donut chart breaking down where technician time goes: 69% hands-on work, 20% travel, 11% idle time—immediately highlighting that reducing idle time by just 2-3% could add thousands in revenue.</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>Business Value Delivered:</h3>
            <p>Management can now see company performance at a glance every Monday morning. Instant visibility into utilization, revenue trends, and callback rates enables data-driven decisions like: "Our callback rate is high this week—let's investigate before it becomes a pattern" or "Installation revenue is low—time to push more installation quotes."</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 3: How Dashboard Solves - Technician Performance -->
        <section class="analysis-section">
          <h2>3. Solution: Individual Technician Performance Tracking</h2>
          <img alt="Technician comparison dashboard page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/dashbord/images/technician-comparison-mockup.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;"/>

          <p>The <strong>Technician Comparison</strong> page transforms subjective performance reviews into objective, data-driven conversations:</p>

          <p><strong>Performance Table with Key Metrics:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Revenue per Tech:</strong> Range from $6,800 to $12,500 — identifying top revenue generators</li>
            <li><strong>Utilization % by Tech:</strong> Range from 58% to 82% — showing a 24-point gap between best and worst performers</li>
            <li><strong>Callback Rate by Tech:</strong> Range from 3% to 12% — pinpointing quality issues to specific technicians</li>
            <li><strong>Average Revenue per Job:</strong> Showing who closes bigger jobs vs. handling only small service calls</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Example Insights from June 2024 Data:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Technician #3:</strong> ⭐ Star performer — $12,500 revenue, 82% utilization, only 3% callbacks. Pattern to emulate.</li>
            <li><strong>Technician #7:</strong> ⚠️ Needs support — $8,200 revenue, 58% utilization, 12% callbacks. Clear coaching opportunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Technician #9:</strong> 📊 High volume, low value — 35 jobs but only $180 avg per job. May need bigger job assignments.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Visual Comparisons:</strong> Side-by-side bar charts show utilization and callback rates across all techs, making outliers instantly visible. Color-coded indicators (green for good, amber for borderline, red for concerning) make interpretation effortless.</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>Coaching Transformation:</h3>
            <p>Instead of vague feedback like "you need to work faster," managers can now say: "Your utilization is 58% while the team average is 72%. Let's look at your time logs and see if we can reduce travel time or idle time." Data-driven coaching leads to 24% performance gap closure opportunities worth $5,000+ per technician annually.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 4: How Dashboard Solves - Trends -->
        <section class="analysis-section">
          <h2>4. Solution: Weekly Trend Analysis & Early Warning System</h2>
          <img alt="Weekly trends dashboard page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/dashbord/images/weekly-trends-mockup.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;"/>

          <p>The <strong>Weekly Trends</strong> page answers the critical question: "Are we getting better or worse over time?"</p>

          <p><strong>Revenue Trend Line (Week-by-Week):</strong> Line chart showing revenue progression from Week 1 ($18,450) to Week 5 ($22,150)—a clear upward trend worth celebrating and understanding ("What did we do right in Week 5?").</p>

          <p><strong>Utilization Trend:</strong> Tracks if efficiency improvements are working. Example: If utilization goes from 69% → 73% → 75% over three weeks, process changes are working. If it's declining, immediate investigation needed.</p>

          <p><strong>Callback Rate Monitoring:</strong> The most important quality indicator. If callbacks spike from 4% → 6% → 8% over consecutive weeks, it signals a systemic quality issue requiring urgent attention before customer satisfaction plummets.</p>

          <p><strong>Job Volume by Category:</strong> Stacked bar chart showing weekly mix of service/repair/install work. Helps correlate marketing campaigns ("We ran an installation promo in Week 3—did it work?") with actual job bookings.</p>

          <p><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> During Monday morning meetings, managers can now say: "Team, great news—utilization improved for the third straight week. Tech #5 and Tech #7, let's talk about what's working so we can share best practices."</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>Early Warning System:</h3>
            <p>Three consecutive weeks of declining utilization or increasing callbacks triggers proactive intervention before problems become entrenched. This shift from reactive to proactive management is worth thousands in prevented issues.</p>
          </div>

        <!-- Section 5: How Dashboard Solves - Quality Issues -->
        <section class="analysis-section">
          <h2>5. Solution: Callback Detection & Quality Improvement</h2>
          <img alt="Callback drill-down dashboard page" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/dashbord/images/callback-drilldown-mockup.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;"/>

          <p>Callbacks—when a technician must return to fix the same problem—are invisible profit killers. The CRM doesn't flag them, but our <strong>Callback Drill-Down</strong> page automatically detects and analyzes them.</p>

          <p><strong>Automated Callback Detection Logic:</strong> A job is flagged as a callback if: (1) same customer as previous job, (2) return visit within 30 days, (3) job notes mention "same issue" or "customer reported problem again," and (4) NOT a scheduled follow-up or routine maintenance.</p>

          <p><strong>June 2024 Results:</strong> Detected 15 callbacks (6.7% of jobs)—above the 5% target. Without this dashboard, these would have gone unnoticed, costing ~$250 per callback in unpaid technician time = $3,750/month = $45,000/year in hidden waste.</p>

          <p><strong>Detailed Callback Table:</strong> Every callback job listed with: Job ID, date, technician, customer, job type, and reason flagged. Managers can review each case individually and discuss with techs.</p>

          <p><strong>Root Cause Analysis Views:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Callbacks by Technician:</strong> Chart showing Tech #7 has 5 callbacks (12% rate) vs. Tech #5 with 1 callback (3% rate)—pinpointing where training is needed</li>
            <li><strong>Callbacks by Job Type:</strong> Are most callbacks on repairs? Installs? Reveals if there's a skills gap in a specific service area</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Action Workflow:</strong> Each Monday, manager reviews new callbacks, discusses with involved technicians ("What happened on Job #0234? How can we prevent this?"), and tracks if interventions reduce future callbacks.</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>Quality ROI:</h3>
            <p>Reducing callback rate from 6.7% to 4.5% eliminates ~5 callbacks per month. At $250 cost per callback (tech time, fuel, parts), that's $1,250/month = $15,000/year savings. Plus improved customer satisfaction leads to more referrals and better reviews.</p>

          <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> CRM systems export messy, siloed data across multiple files. Building a dashboard requires cleaning, merging, and calculating metrics that don't exist in raw data.</p>

          <p><strong>Data Sources (4 CSV Files):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>jobs.csv:</strong> 300 work orders with dates, technicians, customers, job categories, and status</li>
            <li><strong>invoices.csv:</strong> 225 billing records with billable hours, hourly rates, and invoice amounts</li>
            <li><strong>time_logs.csv:</strong> 300 detailed time breakdowns (work hours, travel hours, idle hours)</li>
            <li><strong>technicians.csv:</strong> 10 technician profiles with names and service types</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Data Processing Pipeline (Python Script):</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Load & Clean:</strong> Import all 4 CSVs, fix date formatting issues, handle missing values</li>
            <li><strong>Filter:</strong> Remove 75 cancelled jobs (only analyze completed work)</li>
            <li><strong>Merge:</strong> Join jobs + invoices + time logs + technicians using job_id and technician_id keys</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate Metrics:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Utilization = billable_hours ÷ paid_hours × 100</li>
                <li>Revenue per billable hour = invoice_amount ÷ billable_hours</li>
                <li>Time allocation percentages (work%, travel%, idle%)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Detect Callbacks:</strong> Apply business rules (customer revisits + time window + job notes analysis)</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregate:</strong> Create 3 datasets: job-level (225 rows), technician-level (10 rows), weekly-level (30 rows)</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Save clean CSVs ready for dashboard connection</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Under 5 seconds to transform 300 jobs. Fully repeatable—same script runs weekly on new data exports.</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>Technical Excellence:</h3>
            <p>The magic isn't in fancy algorithms—it's in thoughtful business logic design. Every calculation is documented, every assumption justified, every edge case handled. This makes the system auditable, trustworthy, and maintainable.</p>

        <!-- Section 7: How It Was Built - Dashboard Design -->
        <section class="analysis-section" id="dashboard-preview">
          <h2>7. How It Was Built: Dashboard Design Principles</h2>
          <img alt="Dashboard design mockup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/dashbord/images/dashboard-design-principles.png" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;"/>

          <p><strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> Dashboards fail when they're overcomplicated. Our approach: <em>Show the fewest possible metrics that drive the most action.</em></p>

          <p><strong>4-Page Structure (Looker Studio):</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Company Overview:</strong> 4 top-line scorecards + 3 charts = everything management needs in 10 seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Technician Comparison:</strong> Performance table + 2 comparison charts = basis for coaching conversations</li>
            <li><strong>Weekly Trends:</strong> 4 time-series charts = answer "are we improving?"</li>
            <li><strong>Callback Drill-Down:</strong> Detail table + 2 analysis charts = quality improvement deep-dive</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>User Experience Considerations:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>3-Click Rule:</strong> Any question should be answerable in 3 clicks or less</li>
            <li><strong>Color Psychology:</strong> Green = good, Amber = watch, Red = action needed (traffic light system everyone understands)</li>
            <li><strong>Context Always Visible:</strong> Global filters (date range, technician, job type) appear on every page</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-Friendly:</strong> Scorecards stack vertically, charts resize, tables scroll horizontally on phones</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Interactivity Features:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Click a technician's name → filter entire dashboard to that person</li>
            <li>Click a week on trends page → drill down to that week's jobs</li>
            <li>Hover over any chart → see detailed tooltip with exact values</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Built for Non-Technical Users:</strong> The owner isn't a data analyst. The dashboard uses plain language labels ("Good utilization" not "71.6th percentile"), shows "what good looks like" with reference lines, and includes hover hints explaining each metric.</p>

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>Design Impact:</h3>
            <p>A well-designed dashboard gets used. A confusing one gets ignored. By prioritizing clarity over complexity, we ensured this dashboard would become part of the weekly management routine—not a one-time curiosity that gets abandoned.</p>

          <p><strong>Immediate Insights from June 2024 Data:</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Opportunity #1: Utilization Improvement</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Current company average: 71.6% (good, but room for improvement)</li>
            <li>Best performer: 82% (Tech #3)</li>
            <li>Worst performer: 58% (Tech #7)</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Coaching Tech #7 to company average (72%) adds 14 percentage points = 2.4 extra billable hours/week = $500/month = $6,000/year from one technician</li>
            <li><strong>If all 10 techs hit 75%:</strong> +3.4% utilization = $8,000+ additional annual revenue</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Opportunity #2: Callback Reduction</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Current callback rate: 6.7% (15 callbacks in June)</li>
            <li>Target: 4.5% (10 callbacks)</li>
            <li><strong>Savings per month:</strong> 5 fewer callbacks × $250 cost = $1,250/month = $15,000/year</li>
            <li><strong>Plus:</strong> Better customer satisfaction → more 5-star reviews → more referrals (hard to quantify but significant)</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Opportunity #3: Idle Time Reduction</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Current idle time: 10.5% of paid hours (waiting, delays, downtime)</li>
            <li>Target: 8% (achievable with better scheduling)</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> 2.5% more productive time = 1.5 extra billable hours/week across team = $400/month = $5,000/year</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Opportunity #4: Revenue Mix Optimization</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Current: Only 24% of revenue from installations (typically highest margin)</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic insight:</strong> Focus marketing on installations → shift mix from 24% to 30% = $5,400 revenue shift to higher-margin work = ~$1,500 additional profit annually</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Total Improvement Potential Identified: $31,000+ annually</strong></p>

            <h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
            <p>This isn't just a one-time analysis—it's a scalable business intelligence system. Start with core metrics (we did), prove value (we did), then expand based on what the business needs most. That's how you go from "interesting project" to "indispensable tool."</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This plumber service analytics dashboard demonstrates how thoughtful data engineering and user-centered design transform raw operational data into a strategic business asset. By building repeatable processes, documenting clear business logic, and prioritizing actionable insights over vanity metrics, we created a system that drives $30,000+ in annual improvement opportunities.</p>

          <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Business logic comes first:</strong> Before building visualizations, we defined exactly what each metric means, how it's calculated, and why it matters. This makes the dashboard trustworthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Solve the right problem:</strong> The client didn't need 50 metrics—they needed visibility into the 5-7 metrics that actually drive profitability (utilization, callbacks, revenue trends, technician performance).</li>
            <li><strong>Design for humans:</strong> Use plain language, traffic light colors, and "what good looks like" benchmarks. Non-technical users should feel empowered, not intimidated.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it repeatable:</strong> One-time analysis is interesting; automated weekly updates that require zero manual work are invaluable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This case study represents production-ready work: 225 jobs analyzed, 15 callbacks detected, 112 pages of documentation delivered, and a complete end-to-end system from raw CRM data to actionable dashboards. It showcases data cleaning, business logic design, metric calculation, dashboard architecture, and user experience thinking—core competencies for any data analyst role.</p>

          <p><strong>Beyond the numbers:</strong> The real value isn't the dashboard itself—it's the behavior change it enables. When managers can confidently say "Let's review this week's data" instead of "I think things are going well," that's when data becomes competitive advantage.</p>
