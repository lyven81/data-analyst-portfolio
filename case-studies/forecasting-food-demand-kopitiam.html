                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <p>This study aims to improve food inventory management at a local kopitiam by predicting demand for popular dishes. Using the ARIMA model, we assessed how well we could forecast demand for key items. This helps streamline inventory decisions, boosts sales during peak times, and reduces waste. Key outcomes include better inventory control and strategic promotions for high-demand dishes.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>The kopitiam struggled with managing inventory, often leading to stockouts at busy times or surplus food waste during slow periods. This shows the need for a predictive model to better match food supply with demand, reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>Using historical sales data, we built an ARIMA model to predict food demand. We assessed the model's accuracy using metrics like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), variance, and log likelihood. Our analysis focused on the prediction accuracy for popular dishes and identified sales trends by time of day and week.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prediction Model Analysis:</strong></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>High Accuracy:</strong> Mee Goreng showed high prediction accuracy with a low AIC of -57.85 and minimal variance, making it reliable for inventory planning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Moderate Accuracy:</strong> Roti Canai and Laksa had moderate accuracy, making them suitable for regular inventory updates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lower Accuracy:</strong> Nasi Kandar and Mihun Goreng had higher AIC and variance, indicating less reliable forecasts. A conservative inventory approach is recommended for these items.</li>
