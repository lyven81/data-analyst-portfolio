          <h1>What Sells Best and When</h1>
          <p>A Data-Driven Guide to Boosting Pizza Sales and Operational Efficiency</p>
        </header>

        <section>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>This analysis was conducted to help pizza retail managers improve store performance by focusing on what sells best, when customers buy most, and how to plan operations accordingly. The goal is to provide practical insights to support better decisions around product promotions, inventory planning, and staff scheduling. Managers need fast, reliable information to ensure stores are stocked with high-demand items, staffed efficiently during peak hours, and prepared to respond to sales patterns in real time.</p>
          <p>The analysis addresses key business questions such as which pizzas generate the most revenue, which are consistently fast or slow movers, when order volume peaks during the day, and what sales are expected in the coming weeks. By combining sales data, product classifications, and short-term forecasts, the report helps managers prioritize the right products, avoid unnecessary waste, and match staffing to customer demand. The insights are designed to be directly actionable and easy to apply to weekly planning and daily store operations.</p>

          <h2>1. Which pizzas generate the most revenue by size and category?</h2>
          <p>The top revenue-generating pizzas are large-sized Chicken and Veggie options. The Thai Chicken Pizza leads with RM11,620, followed by The Five Cheese Pizza (RM11,026) and The Four Cheese Pizza (RM9,926). In fact, 9 out of the top 10 best sellers are large-sized, showing that larger pizzas consistently drive more sales. Chicken and Veggie pizzas appear most often in this top group. These findings suggest that promotions and stock planning should prioritize large pizzas in these two categories, particularly the Thai and Cheese variants.</p>

          <h2>2. Which hours consistently see the highest order volume?</h2>
          <p>Customer demand is highest during lunch from 12 PM to 1 PM and again in the evening between 5 PM and 6 PM. The peak is at 12 PM with 2,835 pizzas sold. Sales begin rising at 11 AM and taper off after 7 PM. These time slots represent the busiest hours for kitchen and delivery operations. Staff scheduling and promotional efforts should focus on these windows to meet customer demand and improve operational efficiency.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Which pizzas are fast-moving or slow-moving based on past sales?</h2>
          <p>Using historical data, the model identifies fast-moving pizzas with 66% accuracy. Pizzas like The Hawaiian, Pepperoni, and Barbecue Chicken are confirmed fast movers with high volume. Meanwhile, The Big Meat and Chicken Alfredo Pizzas, although high in sales, were labeled slow movers but outperformed expectations. These may deserve closer attention or model refinement. Fast movers should be prioritized in campaigns and stock planning, while slow movers should be re-evaluated or bundled to drive sales.</p>

          <h2>4. What are the daily sales trends over time?</h2>
          <p>Daily sales show short-term ups and downs but no long-term growth or decline. The 7-day average remains stable between RM2,200 and RM2,600. Revenue peaks in months like January, April, and July likely reflect promotional events or seasonal demand. Rather than expecting steady growth, managers should focus on capturing value during known spikes and planning operations around weekly fluctuations.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>5. What revenue can we expect next week?</h2>
          <p>The forecast for the upcoming week is approximately RM6,500, with possible variation between RM0 and RM13,000. This is lower than past peak weeks, which exceeded RM17,000. Forecast accuracy is moderate, with a margin of error around RM6,000. Managers should prepare conservatively by focusing on fast-selling items and monitoring demand weekly to adjust stock and staff levels as needed.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Are we scheduling staff efficiently during high-traffic periods?</h2>
          <p>Data shows that the busiest times are weekdays between 12 PM and 1 PM and again between 5 PM and 6 PM. Demand is strongest from Monday to Thursday. Weekends and late evenings are less intense. Staff scheduling should match these patterns, with more coverage during weekday lunch and dinner periods and fewer staff during off-peak hours. Weekly sales variation also highlights the need for flexible planning based on forecasted demand.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. How can we align promotions, stock, and staffing with what sells best?</h2>
          <p>To make operations more effective, focus on pizzas that sell frequently and bring in high revenue. The Five Cheese and Spicy Italian pizzas meet both criteria and should be prioritized in promotions and inventory. The Big Meat Pizza, though high in revenue, may require deeper review due to inconsistent classification. With sales expected to be moderate in the coming weeks, stock levels should be balanced and staff allocated to peak sales hours. This approach ensures that efforts are directed toward the right products at the right time.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Sales remain stable overall, with clear peaks during weekday lunch and dinner hours. Large-sized Chicken and Veggie pizzas generate the highest revenue, led by products like the Thai Chicken and Five Cheese pizzas. Forecasted revenue for the upcoming weeks is moderate, indicating no immediate growth. Staff scheduling does not appear fully aligned with peak demand periods, and some high-performing products may not be receiving appropriate promotional focus.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <p>Focus promotions on pizzas that are both high in revenue and fast-moving, such as the Five Cheese and Spicy Italian pizzas. Prioritize inventory for large-sized pizzas in the Chicken and Veggie categories. Concentrate staff schedules during peak hours, especially on weekdays between 12 PM to 1 PM and 5 PM to 6 PM. Avoid overstocking and overstaffing during low-demand periods. Use weekly sales forecasts to adjust staffing and inventory in real time. Aligning product focus, stock levels, and labor with actual demand patterns will improve sales and operational efficiency.</p>
