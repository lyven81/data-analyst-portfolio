                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>The hardware shop owner sought to identify the most effective voucher type to drive margin revenue and increase customer engagement.

                <section>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>A linear regression model was used to predict the total margin and performance metrics for various voucher types. The model's performance was evaluated based on key metrics such as RMSE, total revenue generated, total vouchers issued, redeemed, and the redemption rate for each voucher type. The model's RMSE was 7.50, indicating a reasonable prediction accuracy for the given dataset.</p>
