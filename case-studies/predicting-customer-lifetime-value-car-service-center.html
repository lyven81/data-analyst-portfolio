                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <p>This case study focuses on analyzing customer lifetime value (CLV) for a car service center, using a predictive model to identify high-spending customers. The goal is to offer actionable insights into how customer visit frequency, service preferences, and loyalty programs impact revenue and retention. The analysis highlights the importance of retaining high spenders and encourages strategies to boost engagement, maximize profitability, and enhance long-term customer loyalty.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>The car service center needs to understand the factors influencing customer lifetime value, particularly among high-spending customers, to increase customer retention and optimize revenue generation. Key questions include: How can the car service center retain high spenders, encourage repeat visits, and maximize profitability through tailored services, discounts, or loyalty programs?</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dataset Background:</strong> The dataset provided customer details such as visit frequency, service types, spending patterns, and loyalty program participation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Study Framework:</strong> The framework focused on identifying the spending behaviors of high-value customers and analyzing how service preferences, discounts, and loyalty programs affect predicted lifetime value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Descriptive Query:</strong> The initial descriptive analysis segmented customers into high, medium, and low spenders and examined factors like service types and discount usage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Predictive Model:</strong> A customer lifetime value model was built to predict long-term spending, focusing on high-value customers and identifying patterns in visit frequency, loyalty programs, and discount usage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <h3>1. High Spender Dominance</h3>
                    <p>The analysis found that 2,887 customers are predicted to have a lifetime value exceeding $500, far outweighing the medium spender segment (113 customers with a value between $100 and $500).</p>

                    <h3>2. Visit Frequency Matters</h3>
                    <p>Customers visiting more frequently (e.g., 11 times per year) show a higher lifetime value, with values ranging from $549.95 to $555.05. Encouraging repeat visits through personalized offers or maintenance reminders can lead to significant revenue growth.</p>

                    <h3>3. Loyalty Program Benefits</h3>
                    <p>High-spending loyalty program members have higher predicted lifetime values (up to $574.66), demonstrating the program’s effectiveness in retaining valuable customers. Non-loyalty high spenders still exhibit significant value, indicating an opportunity to increase their engagement through targeted loyalty incentives.</p>

                    <h3>4. Non-Discount Buyers</h3>
                    <p>High spenders who do not use discounts remain highly valuable, with lifetime values between $564.32 and $567.49. These customers show strong brand loyalty, suggesting the car service center should focus on providing premium services rather than offering frequent discounts.</p>

                <h3>5. Model Evaluation</h3>
                <p>The prediction model performed well with an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 271.61, indicating an average error of $271.61 in predicting customer spending. This provides a reasonable level of accuracy in identifying high-spending customers, offering a valuable tool for strategic decision-making.</p>
