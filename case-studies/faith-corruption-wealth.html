                <h1>Faith, Corruption, and Wealth</h1>
                <h2>Does Religion Build Stronger Societies or Hold Them Back?</h2>

                <section>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This study asks a big question: does being a more religious society lead to a better future, or can it hold a country back? To find out, we look at data from different countries on how religion relates to corruption, wealth, and social problems.</p>

                    <p>The goal is to give the general public clear insights based on evidence, not opinion. By comparing patterns and exceptions across countries, the study shows how belief, good governance, and development are linked, and why religion alone cannot explain a nation's success or struggles.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>How do we define religiosity in this study?</h3>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/faith-corruption-wealth/question%200%20religiosity_by_country.png" alt="Religiosity by Country" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p>In this study, religiosity means the share of people in a country who say religion is "very important" in their daily life. It is based on survey data from Pew Research Center and Gallup/Our World in Data, which makes it a measure of personal belief rather than institutional rules.</p>

                    <p>Across the 15 countries we studied, levels of religiosity vary widely. Sweden and Japan are at the low end, with fewer than a quarter of people saying religion matters deeply to them, while countries like Nigeria, Egypt, and Cambodia are at the high end with more than 90%. This wide range gives us a strong base to compare how religiosity connects with corruption, prosperity, and social challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Key Research Questions</h3>

                    <h4>1. Is there really a consistent link between religiosity and corruption?</h4>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/faith-corruption-wealth/question%201%20religiosity_vs_cpi.png" alt="Religiosity vs Corruption Perception Index" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>Yes, the data shows a clear pattern:</strong> the more religious a country is, the more corruption people tend to perceive. The relationship is very strong and holds across most of the 15 countries studied. Nations like Cambodia, Nigeria, and Egypt combine very high religiosity with very low corruption scores, while secular countries like Sweden, Germany, and Japan score much better on governance.</p>

                    <p>That said, there are exceptions. Singapore, for example, is fairly religious but reports low corruption, showing that strong institutions can break the trend. Overall, though, the evidence points to a consistent negative link between religiosity and corruption.</p>

                    <h4>2. Do more religious countries actually tend to be poorer?</h4>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/faith-corruption-wealth/question%202%20religiosity_vs_gdp.png" alt="Religiosity vs GDP per Capita" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>At first glance, religious countries do seem poorer.</strong> Highly religious nations like Nigeria and Cambodia have much lower incomes, while secular countries such as Sweden, Germany, and Japan are among the richest. But once corruption is factored in, religiosity itself no longer predicts wealth.</p>

                    <p>This means that corruption is the real driver of poverty, not religion. Singapore proves the point: it is both religious and highly prosperous, showing that good governance matters more than belief when it comes to building a strong economy.</p>

                    <h4>3. Do more religious countries also show higher levels of social problems, such as crime or violence?</h4>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/faith-corruption-wealth/question%203%20-%20religiosity_vs_homicide.png" alt="Religiosity vs Homicide Rate" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>The short answer is no.</strong> While some highly religious countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Nigeria face high levels of violence, others like Indonesia, Cambodia, and Egypt do not. When tested statistically, religiosity has no significant effect on crime once corruption and income are considered.</p>

                    <p>Instead, corruption stands out as the strongest factor. Countries with weaker governance consistently show higher levels of violence. This shows that religion itself does not drive crime, but the quality of institutions plays a much bigger role in shaping social stability.</p>

                    <h4>4. Are there exceptions â€“ countries that are both religious and prosperous, or secular but corrupt?</h4>
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/faith-corruption-wealth/question%204%20-%20exception_analysis_scatter.png" alt="Exception Analysis - Religious vs Secular Countries" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <p><strong>Yes, and these cases are important</strong> because they show that religiosity is not destiny. Singapore is the clearest example: it is relatively religious but also one of the richest and least corrupt countries in the world. The United States and Mexico also sit outside the general trend, combining religiosity with stronger economies than expected.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, most highly religious countries still fall at the poorer end, while secular countries tend to dominate the wealthier side. The exceptions prove that strong governance and institutions can override the usual patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strong correlation exists</strong> between religiosity and perceived corruption across nations</li>
                        <li><strong>Corruption, not religion,</strong> is the primary driver of economic poverty</li>
                        <li><strong>Institutional quality</strong> matters more than religious beliefs for societal outcomes</li>
                        <li><strong>Singapore serves as a model</strong> showing religious societies can be prosperous with good governance</li>
                        <li><strong>Religion appears to be a response</strong> to weak institutions rather than their cause</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The findings suggest that religion is not the root cause of social problems. Instead, people tend to turn to religion in societies where corruption is high and institutions are weak. The data shows a strong link between corruption and religiosity, but only a weak link between religiosity and income.</p>

                    <p>This means that higher religiosity is often a response to instability, not the cause of it. In short, religion alone does not make or break a society. What matters most is the strength of governance and institutions, which consistently shape prosperity, reduce corruption, and determine the role religion plays in people's lives.</p>

                    <p><strong>The key takeaway is clear:</strong> building strong, fair institutions is the real foundation of national progress, regardless of a society's level of religiosity.</p>
