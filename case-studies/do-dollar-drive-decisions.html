          <h1>Do Dollar Drive Decisions?</h1>
          <h2>Uncovering Lending Patterns Across Income Levels</h2>
          <p>Explore how income may be shaping loan approvals and interest rates—and how to ensure your lending process remains both fair and profitable.</p>

          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>This analysis examines whether income level affects loan terms, particularly interest rates, loan amounts, and credit grading. The goal is to assess fairness in lending practices and uncover whether risk—or bias—is driving lending outcomes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Key Results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Interest Rate Differences by Income:</strong> Higher-income applicants get lower rates (10.90%) vs. lower-income (11.99%). <br><em>Implication: Rate assignments may reflect income-based assumptions about risk.</em></li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/do-dollar-drive-decisions/Chart%201%20Low-Income%20Group%20Received%20Slightly%20Higher%20Interest%20Rates.png" alt="Interest Rate by Income" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;">

            <li><strong>Loan Amounts vs. Income:</strong> Weak correlation (0.37) between income and loan size. <br><em>Implication: Income doesn’t significantly affect loan amount decisions.</em></li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/do-dollar-drive-decisions/Chart%202%20No%20Strong%20Correlation%20Found%20Between%20Income%20and%20Loan%20Amoun.png" alt="Loan Amount and Income" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;">

            <li><strong>Credit Grades Skewed by Income:</strong> Higher-income applicants more likely to receive grades A or B; lower-income skew toward grades C–E. <br><em>Implication: Grading may reflect income bias, not just risk.</em></li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/do-dollar-drive-decisions/Chart%203%20Higher-Income%20Group%20Is%20More%20Likely%20to%20Receive%20Better%20Loan%20Ratings.png" alt="Credit Grade Distribution by Income" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;">

            <li><strong>Financial Risk Profiles:</strong> Higher-income borrowers have lower debt-to-income ratios and credit utilization. <br><em>Implication: Lower risk supports better terms—but should be objectively evaluated.</em></li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/do-dollar-drive-decisions/Chart%204%20Higher-Income%20Group%20Has%20Lower%20Loan%20Risk.png" alt="Loan Risk by Income" style="width:100%; max-width:700px;">
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Aligning Findings with Business Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fairness & Compliance:</strong> Ensure risk—not income—is the basis for loan decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimize Loan Products:</strong> Use these findings to create fairer, more targeted offerings for all income groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Strengthen Customer Trust:</strong> Transparent grading and fair terms can improve long-term satisfaction and loyalty.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Business Impact</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fair Lending:</strong> Mitigate risk of discrimination by rooting decisions in risk data—not income assumptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue Optimization:</strong> Use insights to refine pricing strategy and boost profitability.</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Meet fairness standards and reduce exposure to legal or reputational risk.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Interpretation of Results</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rate Differences:</strong> Risk—not income—should drive lower interest rates. Current trends may blend both.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Amount Factors:</strong> Factors like credit score and obligations weigh heavier than income.</li>
            <li><strong>Grading Disparity:</strong> High-income bias may exist in grade assignments; call for more objective grading systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Indicators:</strong> High-income borrowers show objectively lower risk, but systemic grading must remain neutral.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Contextual Factors</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Economic Conditions:</strong> High-income borrowers may benefit from better financial stability, affecting credit behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Trends:</strong> Shifts in lending strategy and consumer behavior can impact how income is factored into decisions.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. Recommendations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Review Rate Policies:</strong> Ensure interest rates are set by creditworthiness, not income.</li>
            <li><strong>Revise Credit Grading:</strong> Eliminate unintentional income-based favoritism in grading systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Data-Driven Loan Limits:</strong> Set loan amounts using combined risk metrics—not income alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Audit for Bias:</strong> Regularly review income representation across grades and terms to identify skewed patterns.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Income plays a role in how loans are assigned—but the true driver should be risk. This analysis provides a framework for making data-driven improvements to ensure fairer, smarter, and more compliant lending decisions across income groups.</p>
