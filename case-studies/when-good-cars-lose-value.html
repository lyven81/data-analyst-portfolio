                    <p>This report examines the key drivers behind vehicles being sold below their expected market price (Manheim Market Report, or MMR), focusing on how vehicle condition and mileage affect resale performance. It provides model-level insight and strategic recommendations for pricing, maintenance, and inventory decisions.</p>

                    <h3>Underperforming Mileage and Condition Segments</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medium condition vehicles are most likely to sell below MMR, especially those with over 100K miles.</li>

                        <li>Resale value starts dropping beyond 8,145 miles even for high-condition cars—marking a tipping point in buyer perception.</li>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/when-good-cars-lose-value/Chart%202.1%208%2C145%20Miles_%20The%20Threshold%20Above%20Which%20Vehicle%20Value%20Drops%2C%20Even%20in%20Good%20Condition.png" alt="Chart 2.1">

                    <h3>Condition Overvaluation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High-condition cars surprisingly showed the largest average price drops, suggesting overpricing risk.</li>
                        <li>Medium and low condition vehicles performed more consistently with MMR benchmarks.</li>

                        <li>High-condition vehicles with >100K mileage averaged $1,000 losses.</li>
                        <li>Cars with 25K–100K mileage saw smaller losses—making them more stable investment options.</li>

                        <li><strong>Reduce Financial Loss:</strong> Flag underperformers early to avoid avoidable revenue leakage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improve Operations:</strong> Focus reconditioning efforts and inventory planning where returns are strongest.</li>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Data Insights and Interpretation</h2>
                    <p><strong>Mileage & Condition Impact:</strong> Medium-condition cars over 100K miles were the worst performers—confirming compounding risk.</p>
                    <p><strong>Value Decline Threshold:</strong> Even high-condition cars start dropping in value past 8,145 miles—consumer perception matters.</p>
                    <p><strong>Condition Mispricing:</strong> Buyers seem unwilling to pay a premium for high condition alone.</p>
                    <p><strong>Make/Model Risk:</strong> Brands like Audi, Ford, and Nissan underperformed, questioning assumptions about brand value.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Refine High-Mileage Pricing:</strong> Use adjusted pricing thresholds and sell before value drops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prioritize Medium-Condition Vehicles:</strong> Recondition where ROI is likely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Review High-Condition Pricing:</strong> Shift pricing strategies to include bundled value rather than relying solely on condition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust for Model Risk:</strong> Avoid or reprice known underperformers like Audi A4.</li>
                        <li><strong>Threshold-Based Promotions:</strong> Promote vehicles near the 8,145-mile mark before losses increase.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>This analysis shows how easily good cars can lose value if not priced or timed right. By using smart data strategies—like watching mileage thresholds, realigning price expectations, and tracking underperforming models—dealers and businesses can stop value leaks before they start and get more from every vehicle in inventory.</p>
