        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This case study looks at the performance of a keyword ad campaign for a potato chip retailer. It focuses on finding the best keywords and improving how the ad budget is spent. The campaign ran from January to March 2024, using 50 keywords to drive online sales for one product. We found that some keywords worked much better than others, giving clear ideas on how to improve future campaigns.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The retailer is unsure which keywords bring in the best return on ad spend (ROAS), conversions, and customer engagement. The goal is to figure out which keywords worked best and how to adjust the ad budget to make future campaigns more efficient and profitable.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection & Aggregation:</strong> We used SQL to gather data on key metrics like ad spend, impressions, clicks, ROAS, and revenue for each keyword.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Analysis:</strong> The data was analyzed to see which keywords performed best, focusing on ROAS, click-through rate (CTR), and conversion rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Correlation Study:</strong> We also looked at how ad spend and keyword performance related to sales. This helped guide future budget decisions.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h3>3. Underperforming Keywords</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"Salted potato chips" and "limited edition potato chips" had lower ROAS (6.78 and 7.39), which led to less revenue and higher costs per sale.</li>

        <h3>4. Correlation Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High CTR, Low Conversion:</strong> Keywords like "imported potato chips" and "potato chips for parties" had high click-through rates but didn’t convert well into sales. This could mean the ad content didn’t match what customers expected.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low CTR, High Conversion:</strong> "Healthy potato chips" had a lower click-through rate but higher conversions, meaning it might benefit from better targeting or bidding strategies.</li>
        </ul>
