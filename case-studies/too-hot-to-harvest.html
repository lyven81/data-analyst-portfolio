      <h2>
       Study Context:
      </h2>
      <p>
       This analysis is focusing on the average temperature in Delhi from 1951 to 2023. The dataset provides information on yearly temperature trends and their potential impact on rice farming. This study aims to answer whether the rising temperature in Delhi poses a long-term challenge to rice cultivation, specifically assessing the statistical significance of the warming trend and its potential implications for crop planning, yield, and farming practices.

      <h2>
       Overview:
      </h2>
      <p>
       The goal of this study is to evaluate the long-term temperature trend in Delhi and its implications for rice farming. Using linear regression analysis, the study investigates the rate of temperature increase, the reliability of this trend, and whether Delhi has reached a critical temperature threshold that could affect rice productivity. The insights derived will help inform adaptation strategies for rice farmers and provide evidence for government policy, agri-tech companies, and supporting stakeholders in the agricultural sector.

      <h2>
       Key Questions
      </h2>
      <h3>
       1. Is there a statistically significant increase in average temperature over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
       The analysis confirms a statistically significant increase in Delhi's average temperature from 1951 to 2023. The regression analysis shows a positive slope, with a p-value of 0.035, which is below the 0.05 threshold, indicating that the increase in temperature is not due to random variation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statistically significant warming trend highlights the need for climate monitoring, long-term planning, and adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact on agricultural productivity.
      </p>

      <h3>
       2. What is the rate of temperature increase per year?
      </h3>
      <p>
       The linear regression model estimates the annual temperature increase in Delhi at 0.0084°C per year. Although the R² value is 0.0879, meaning the model explains 8.8% of the variation in temperature, the rate of increase remains statistically relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       This annual rate provides a benchmark for estimating future climate scenarios. Even a modest annual increase compounds over decades, which could eventually affect crop cycles and productivity in the long run.
      </p>

      <h3>
       3. How confident are we in the trend?
      </h3>
      <p>
       The confidence interval for the regression slope is [0.0020, 0.0147], excluding zero, which reinforces the statistical reliability of the warming trend. The narrow confidence band around the trend line suggests that the rate of temperature increase is both stable and consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       This strong statistical evidence makes the warming trend reliable and supports the need for proactive adaptation in agricultural practices, such as heat-tolerant rice varieties or changes to sowing schedules.
      </p>
      <img alt="Chart 3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/too-hot-to-harvest/chart%203%20linear%20regression.png" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"/>
      <h3>
       4. What proportion of recent years exceeded a critical temperature threshold (≥35°C)?
      </h3>
      <p>
       The analysis reveals that no years have crossed the critical threshold of 35°C annually, meaning there have been no recorded years with an average temperature high enough to trigger rice crop stress.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is reassuring in the short term, but farmers should remain vigilant as extreme temperatures could still occur during specific growing seasons. Monitoring seasonal temperatures and heat spikes will be crucial for adapting to future climate shifts.
      </p>
      <h3>
       5. What does this mean for the future of rice farming in Delhi?
      </h3>
      <p>
       While the warming trend is significant, the critical temperature threshold for rice farming has not been breached yet. However, the rate of temperature increase (0.0084°C/year) suggests that future years may experience conditions more detrimental to rice growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The future of rice farming in Delhi will require proactive measures. This includes investing in heat-resistant rice varieties, adjusting planting calendars to avoid extreme heat, and improving irrigation systems. Collaboration with agri-tech for microclimate forecasting can help farmers anticipate heat risks and mitigate their impact.
