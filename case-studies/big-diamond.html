       Study Context:
      </h2>
      <p>
       The study was conducted on a random sample of 2400 diamonds selected from a total stock of 54,000 diamonds. The purpose of this study is to identify the proportion of premium diamonds (defined as diamonds with a carat weight of ≥ 1.00 carat) within the inventory and to explore how carat size affects diamond pricing. This analysis focuses on diamonds that meet the 1.00 carat or larger criteria and aims to understand their pricing trends, helping the business optimize pricing strategies, inventory management, and marketing efforts.
      </p>
     </section>

      <h2>
       Overview:
      </h2>
      <p>
       This analysis addresses key questions regarding the distribution of premium diamonds in the inventory and their pricing behavior. Specifically, it focuses on identifying how many diamonds in the sample are 1 carat or larger, how carat size influences pricing, and how reliable these estimates are when applied to the entire inventory.

       Key Results:
      </h2>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Diamonds ≥ 1.00 Carat and ≥ 2.00 Carats:
        </strong>
        <ul>
         <li>
          853 diamonds (35.54% of the sample) have a carat weight of 1.00 carat or larger, which means over one-third of the inventory falls into the premium or near-premium category.
         </li>
         <li>
          110 diamonds (4.58% of the sample) are 2.00 carats or larger, representing a much smaller segment of the inventory.
         </li>
         <li>
          This finding helps the business assess whether its inventory aligns with the demands of premium customers. The current count of larger diamonds may need to grow if the business aims to attract upscale buyers or expand into luxury markets. Alternatively, this distribution may reflect a balanced inventory that supports value-conscious buyers, which can be validated by analyzing actual sales data.
         </li>
         <img alt="Bar chart 1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/big-diamond/chart%201%20-%20bar%20chart.png"/>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Percentage of Total Diamonds in Premium Categories:
        </strong>
        <ul>
         <li>
          31.0% of the diamonds in the sample fall into the 1.00–1.99 carat range, while 4.6% are 2.00 carats or larger.
         </li>
         <li>
          In total, 35.6% of the diamonds meet the premium classification of ≥ 1.00 carat. The remaining 64.4% of the diamonds are smaller than 1.00 carat, indicating a strong presence of more accessible, lower-priced diamonds in the inventory.
         </li>
         <li>
          This distribution clarifies how the inventory is structured across different price tiers. For businesses targeting luxury buyers, the premium segment may appear underrepresented. However, if profitability is driven by the higher turnover of smaller diamonds, this inventory structure could be working well. Leadership should review sales data to determine whether the current inventory mix aligns with broader brand goals and target markets.
         </li>
         <img alt="Bar chart 2" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/big-diamond/chart%202%20-%20bar%20chart.png"/>

       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Confidence in Estimates for Whole Inventory:
        </strong>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Based on the sample of 2,400 diamonds, the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of diamonds ≥ 1.00 carat ranges from 34% to 37% of the total inventory, and for diamonds ≥ 2.00 carat, the confidence interval ranges from 4% to 5%.
         </li>
         <li>
          The narrow confidence intervals suggest that the estimates are statistically reliable. This strengthens the business's ability to make informed decisions about premium diamond pricing, inventory stocking, and promotion planning with high confidence, without needing to analyze the entire inventory.
         </li>
         <img alt="Bar chart 3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/big-diamond/chart%203%20-%20error%20bar%20chart.png"/>

        <strong>
         Carat Weight as a Price Predictor for Diamonds ≥ 1.00 Carat:
        </strong>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Among the diamonds with ≥ 1.00 carat, a striking 93.4% are priced above the average diamond price of $4,306.90.
         </li>
         <li>
          This indicates that carat size is a strong predictor of pricing for diamonds in this category, making them prime candidates for premium positioning in marketing campaigns. Sales teams can confidently promote diamonds with larger carat sizes as luxury items, leveraging their premium pricing to justify higher margins.
         </li>
         <img alt="Bar chart 4" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/big-diamond/chart%204%20-%20bar%20chart.png"/>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Carat Weight as a Price Predictor for Diamonds ≥ 2.00 Carat:
        </strong>
        <ul>
         <li>
          100% of diamonds that are 2.00 carats or larger are priced above the average price of $4,306.90. Every diamond in this size range qualifies as a high-value item.
         </li>
         <li>
          This finding reinforces the luxury branding strategy for diamonds 2 carats or larger. Since all diamonds in this category are priced above the average, they should be positioned as flagship products in exclusive offerings, limited collections, or high-end promotions. Their pricing potential justifies special attention in inventory planning, pricing strategy, and customer segmentation.

        <strong>
         Revenue Growth:
        </strong>
        The findings highlight that diamonds ≥ 1.00 carat consistently command higher prices, allowing the company to adjust its marketing and sales strategies to maximize revenue from premium products.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Inventory Management:
        </strong>
        The 35.6% share of premium diamonds suggests that the company should carefully assess whether it needs to adjust its inventory to meet luxury market demands or whether the current distribution suits its broader customer base.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Customer Engagement:
        </strong>

       Data Interpretation:

      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Proportion of Premium Diamonds (≥ 1.00 Carat):
        </strong>
        The fact that 35.6% of the diamonds in the inventory are 1 carat or larger suggests a moderate focus on premium products. The relatively smaller percentage of 2.00 carat or larger diamonds (4.6%) indicates that these luxury items are rare, but potentially very lucrative.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Price Correlation with Carat Weight:
        </strong>
        As expected, carat size plays a significant role in determining diamond pricing. The strong correlation between carat size and premium pricing suggests that larger diamonds are perceived as more valuable and should be marketed as such. This supports the need for a premium pricing strategy for diamonds that meet the 1.00 carat threshold and above.

       <li>
        <strong>
         Luxury Demand:
        </strong>
        Demand for larger diamonds, particularly those 2 carats or larger, is driven by high-net-worth individuals and special events (e.g., engagements). This luxury segment, while small, offers significant potential for high-margin sales.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Market Trends:
        </strong>
        With increasing interest in premium jewelry and luxury engagement rings, demand for diamonds of 1 carat or larger may continue to rise, making it essential for the business to focus on these diamonds as a key revenue driver.

     <section>
      <h2>
       Recommendations:
      </h2>
      <p>
       The data confirms that larger diamonds are priced higher, and the company should strategically market diamonds ≥ 1.00 carat as premium items. While the inventory has a healthy proportion of premium diamonds, focusing on increasing the stock of 2.00 carat or larger diamonds may cater to the growing demand for luxury products.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Increase Stock of Premium Diamonds (≥ 1.00 Carat):
        </strong>
        To meet the growing demand for luxury diamonds, the company should consider expanding its stock of diamonds ≥ 1.00 carat. Additionally, marketing efforts should emphasize these products to attract high-end customers.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Promote Diamonds ≥ 2.00 Carat as Flagship Products:
        </strong>
        Diamonds ≥ 2.00 carat should be positioned as flagship products for exclusive collections or high-end promotions. These diamonds should receive special attention in marketing and be priced to reflect their luxury status.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Refine Pricing Strategy for Smaller Diamonds:
        </strong>
        For diamonds under 1.00 carat, the company should refine its pricing strategy, taking into account factors such as cut, clarity, and color. This will help ensure competitive pricing without sacrificing profit margins.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Monitor Market Demand for Luxury Products:
        </strong>
        Given the potential for higher sales in the luxury segment, the company should monitor market demand for premium diamonds and adjust its inventory and pricing strategy accordingly.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>
       Conclusion:
      </h2>
      <p>
       The analysis reveals that carat weight is a strong indicator of diamond pricing, with diamonds ≥ 1.00 carat commanding a premium price. The company should strategically focus on expanding its inventory of larger diamonds and position them as luxury products to attract high-end buyers. By refining its pricing strategy for smaller diamonds and leveraging carat size as a pricing factor, the business can optimize revenue and inventory management, aligning its offerings with customer expectations in both the luxury and value markets.
