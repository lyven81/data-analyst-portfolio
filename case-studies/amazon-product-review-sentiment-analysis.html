        <h2>Results</h2>
        <h3>Positive Sentiment Dominance</h3>
        <p><strong>Insight:</strong> The analysis shows that over 70 reviews are classified as "positive," indicating strong customer satisfaction, particularly in the jewelry category. This positive sentiment is a key indicator of brand loyalty, essential for encouraging repeat purchases and long-term customer retention.</p>
        <p><strong>Actionable Recommendation:</strong> Businesses should leverage this strong positive sentiment by highlighting favorable reviews in marketing campaigns. Emphasizing customer satisfaction and product quality can further strengthen the brand's image and attract new customers.</p>

        <h3>Negative Sentiment Insights</h3>
        <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Approximately 25 reviews are classified as "negative." These reviews highlight issues such as product quality, durability, and customer service.</p>
        <p><strong>Actionable Recommendation:</strong> Conduct a thorough analysis of negative reviews to identify recurring issues. Implement targeted product improvements and enhance customer service to address these concerns, thereby reducing the incidence of negative feedback.</p>

        <h3>Absence of Negative Sentiment Among Star Reviews</h3>
        <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Interestingly, there is no negative sentiment among products with star ratings. This suggests that dissatisfied customers may choose not to leave a star rating, possibly due to a lack of motivation to provide feedback.</p>
        <p><strong>Actionable Recommendation:</strong> Encourage more balanced feedback by prompting all customers, including those who may be dissatisfied, to leave reviews. This approach will provide a more comprehensive view of customer satisfaction and help identify areas for improvement.</p>
