          <p><em>Understanding How Social Media Affects Real-Life Relationships</em></p>

        <section>
          <h2>Purpose and Key Results</h2>
          <p>This case study explores how time spent on social media correlates with the quality of students’ real-life relationships, and how this relationship differs based on their living environment...</p>

          <h3>1. Is there a measurable correlation between time spent on social media and real-life relationship quality?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a very weak positive correlation (Pearson r = 0.1244)...</li>
            <li>Among students who use social media heavily...</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>2. Does this correlation vary across different living environments (urban, suburban, rural)?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The correlation between social media use and relationship quality varies by living environment...</li>
            <li>These findings suggest...</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>3. Are there noticeable patterns in how different usage levels report changes in their relationships?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Students using social media for 1–2 hours a day showed the most balanced outcomes...</li>
            <li>Students using 3–5 hours daily reported the lowest improvement...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%203%20-%20group%20bar%20chart.png" alt="Chart 3">
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Do some students report improved relationships despite high usage? What distinguishes these cases?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>6 heavy social media users reported improved relationships...</li>
            <li>Most of these students lived in urban or rural areas...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%204%20-%20bar%20chart%20facebook.png" alt="Chart 4 Facebook">

          </ul>

          <h3>5. What is the probability that social media improves relationships?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Only 30.61% of students reported improved relationships...</li>
            <li>40% of students who felt their relationships improved...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%205.png" alt="Chart 5">
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Which group appears most at risk of worsened relationships, and what early signs should adults watch for?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Students most at risk of worsened relationships tend to use social media 3–5 hours per day...</li>
            <li>Early warning signs for adults include...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%206%20-%20bar%20chart%201.png" alt="Chart 6">
          </ul>

          <h3>7. What is the probability that social media usage worsens relationship quality?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>34.69% of all students reported worsened relationships due to social media...</li>
            <li>Only 29.41% of those who felt harmed were heavy users...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%207%20bar%20chart.png" alt="Chart 7">
          </ul>

          <h3>8. How does the use of messaging apps like WhatsApp relate to relationship outcomes?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Students who use WhatsApp daily reported a positive average relationship score of +0.11...</li>
            <li>Those who use WhatsApp only a few times a week or never had negative scores...</li>

          <h2>Relevance to Community and Stakeholder Goals</h2>
          <p>This study addresses the concerns of adults supporting youth by identifying how digital behavior relates to emotional well-being and social development.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>For parents:</strong> it offers a clearer picture of when digital habits may be affecting their child’s emotional or social health.</li>
            <li><strong>For teachers:</strong> it suggests when to adjust digital literacy instruction or offer guidance on healthy screen habits.</li>
            <li><strong>For social workers and counselors:</strong> it helps prioritize students who show warning signs and tailor support programs by environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Understanding these patterns allows stakeholders to support young individuals not simply by limiting screen time but by encouraging digital practices that foster meaningful interaction.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Explaining the Results</h2>
          <p>The weak overall correlation indicates that simply spending time on social media does not determine whether relationships get better or worse. Other factors, such as platform choice, communication frequency, and living environment, significantly influence outcomes.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Daily WhatsApp use aligns with stronger reported relationship quality, possibly due to frequent and meaningful communication.</li>
            <li>Students in urban settings may benefit more from digital platforms because they supplement busy or fragmented in-person interactions.</li>
            <li>3–5 hours/day users show the most consistently negative outcomes, suggesting this is a threshold beyond which screen time may begin to displace offline bonding.</li>
            <li>High-usage students who benefit tend to use social media in more personal and socially reinforcing ways, indicating purpose and platform matter more than volume.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <p>To promote healthier relationships and emotional well-being in young people, we recommend:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Encourage meaningful use:</strong> Guide students to use platforms like WhatsApp or group chats for frequent and sincere communication rather than passive browsing.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch the 3–5 hour range:</strong> Students in this time bracket are the most at risk for worsened relationships. Offer targeted support and education for this group.</li>
            <li><strong>Tailor strategies by living environment:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>In urban areas:</strong> promote balance by complementing fast-paced online communication with quality offline experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>In suburban areas:</strong> focus on restoring offline engagement and community ties.</li>
                <li><strong>In rural areas:</strong> digital tools can be an effective supplement to limited in-person social options but require careful emotional support.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Focus on early signs:</strong> Watch for students with:
              <ul>
                <li>Daily WhatsApp use</li>
                <li>Emotional withdrawal</li>
                <li>3–5 hours/day online habits</li>
                <li>Reports of negative mental health</li>
              </ul>
              These are students most likely to benefit from check-ins and guided conversations about their social and emotional lives.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This analysis shows that while social media use is not inherently good or bad, its impact depends on usage patterns, communication style, and social context. By shifting the focus from screen time to quality of interaction and emotional health, parents, teachers, and social workers can better support students in forming meaningful relationships both online and offline.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, interventions should balance digital literacy with emotional education, helping youth build strong relationships in an increasingly connected yet complex world.</p>
