          <p><em>Understanding How Social Media Affects Real-Life Relationships</em></p>
        </header>

        <section>
          <h2>Purpose and Key Results</h2>
          <p>This case study explores how time spent on social media correlates with the quality of students’ real-life relationships, and how this relationship differs based on their living environment...</p>

          <h3>1. Is there a measurable correlation between time spent on social media and real-life relationship quality?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>There is a very weak positive correlation (Pearson r = 0.1244)...</li>
            <li>Among students who use social media heavily...</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>2. Does this correlation vary across different living environments (urban, suburban, rural)?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The correlation between social media use and relationship quality varies by living environment...</li>
            <li>These findings suggest...</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>3. Are there noticeable patterns in how different usage levels report changes in their relationships?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Students using social media for 1–2 hours a day showed the most balanced outcomes...</li>
            <li>Students using 3–5 hours daily reported the lowest improvement...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%203%20-%20group%20bar%20chart.png" alt="Chart 3">
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Do some students report improved relationships despite high usage? What distinguishes these cases?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>6 heavy social media users reported improved relationships...</li>
            <li>Most of these students lived in urban or rural areas...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%204%20-%20bar%20chart%20facebook.png" alt="Chart 4 Facebook">

          </ul>

          <h3>5. What is the probability that social media improves relationships?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Only 30.61% of students reported improved relationships...</li>
            <li>40% of students who felt their relationships improved...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%205.png" alt="Chart 5">
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Which group appears most at risk of worsened relationships, and what early signs should adults watch for?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Students most at risk of worsened relationships tend to use social media 3–5 hours per day...</li>
            <li>Early warning signs for adults include...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%206%20-%20bar%20chart%201.png" alt="Chart 6">
          </ul>

          <h3>7. What is the probability that social media usage worsens relationship quality?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>34.69% of all students reported worsened relationships due to social media...</li>
            <li>Only 29.41% of those who felt harmed were heavy users...</li>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/connected-or-disconnected/chart%207%20bar%20chart.png" alt="Chart 7">
          </ul>

          <h3>8. How does the use of messaging apps like WhatsApp relate to relationship outcomes?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Students who use WhatsApp daily reported a positive average relationship score of +0.11...</li>
            <li>Those who use WhatsApp only a few times a week or never had negative scores...</li>

          <h2>Relevance to Community and Stakeholder Goals</h2>
          <p>This study addresses the concerns of adults supporting youth by identifying how digital behavior relates to emotional well-being and social development.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>For parents:</strong> it offers a clearer picture of when digital habits may be affecting their child’s emotional or social health.</li>
            <li><strong>For teachers:</strong> it suggests when to adjust digital literacy instruction or offer guidance on healthy screen habits.</li>
            <li><strong>For social workers and counselors:</strong> it helps prioritize students who show warning signs and tailor support programs by environment.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Explaining the Results</h2>
          <p>The weak overall correlation indicates that simply spending time on social media does not determine whether relationships get better or worse...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Daily WhatsApp use aligns with stronger reported relationship quality...</li>
            <li>Students in urban settings may benefit more from digital platforms...</li>
            <li>3–5 hours/day users show the most consistently negative outcomes...</li>
            <li>High-usage students who benefit tend to use social media in more personal and socially reinforcing ways...</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Encourage meaningful use of social platforms...</li>
            <li>Watch the 3–5 hour range: offer targeted support and education for this group.</li>
            <li>Tailor strategies by living environment...
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Urban areas:</strong> promote offline engagement to balance fast-paced online communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Suburban areas:</strong> reconnect students to local community life.</li>
                <li><strong>Rural areas:</strong> offer digital tools while supporting emotional wellness.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Focus on early signs: frequent WhatsApp use, emotional withdrawal, 3–5 hour screen time, and mental health signals.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This analysis shows that while social media use is not inherently good or bad, its impact depends on usage patterns, communication style, and social context...</p>
          <p>Interventions should balance digital literacy with emotional education to support student well-being in a connected world.</p>
