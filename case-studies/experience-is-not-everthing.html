        Rethinking What Really Drives Salary Growth
       </em>
      </p>
     </header>
     <section>
      <h2>
       Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
       This analysis was conducted to answer a pressing question many career-driven employees face: Does gaining more experience guarantee higher salary? In the absence of formal job titles or promotion records, this study uses years of experience as a proxy for career level, and department as a proxy for role category. The goal is to uncover patterns that influence salary progression and help employees make smarter decisions about their career trajectory.
      </p>

      <h2>
       Key Results
      </h2>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The analysis shows no meaningful correlation between salary and experience (Pearson r = 0.0039, p = 0.902), and salary levels remain similar across all experience bands with no clear upward trend.
       </li>
       <li>
        HR should align pay with role value and performance, while employees are better off focusing on skills, impact, or role shifts rather than relying solely on tenure for salary growth.
       </li>
       <img alt="Chart 1 - Box Plot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/experince-is-not-everything/Chart%201%20-%20box%20plot.png"/>
       <li>
        The data reveals that salary growth patterns differ by department: IT offers the highest starting pay but declines over time, HR provides steady upward progression, and Sales remains largely flat across experience levels.
       </li>
       <li>
        Compensation strategies should be department-specific—HR encourages long-term growth, IT may need retention plans, and Sales could benefit from performance-based incentives to drive motivation.
       </li>
       <img alt="Chart 2 - Line Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/experince-is-not-everything/chart%202%20-%20line%20chart.png"/>
       <li>
        The analysis shows no clear “sweet spot” in salary growth, with the highest average salary appearing in the 0–5 year band and little to no increase across longer experience levels; most employees earn under $1,100 per year of experience.
       </li>
       <li>
        HR should reassess how long-term experience is rewarded, while employees are encouraged to focus on early-career momentum, skill-building, and strategic moves rather than relying on tenure for salary advancement.
       </li>
       <img alt="Chart 3 - Line Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/experince-is-not-everything/chart%203%20-%20line%20chart.png"/>
       <li>
        The Random Forest model built to predict future salary based on employee profile had limited accuracy (R² = -0.169), but highlighted that age, experience, and performance score are stronger predictors than department or gender.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
       Goals Alignment
      </h2>
      <p>
       The company's goal is to promote a transparent and motivating salary structure that supports long-term talent retention and equity across departments. This study directly supports that by revealing which departments foster steady salary growth and which may require compensation adjustments.
      </p>

      <h2>
       Impact
      </h2>
      <p>
       The findings challenge the assumption that experience alone drives salary increases. Instead, they emphasize the need for department-specific strategies and growth paths to reward employees meaningfully. This insight enables both employees and HR to align promotions and salary expectations with actual growth patterns, enhancing planning, fairness, and retention strategies.
      </p>

     <section>
      <h2>
       Data Interpretation
      </h2>
      <p>
       The weak correlation between salary and experience indicates that experience alone is not a reliable predictor of salary growth. Box plots and distribution analysis confirmed that salaries remain relatively flat across experience bands, while some departments, such as HR, show moderate upward trends, and IT shows an early peak followed by decline.
      </p>
      <p>
       The salary per year of experience metric revealed that most employees earn below $1,100 per year, and high-efficiency earners are statistical outliers. This further supports the conclusion that salary increases are not proportionally tied to years worked.

      <h2>
       Contextual Factors
      </h2>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Market-driven pay scales for technical roles may frontload compensation in IT.
       </li>
       <li>
        Flat organizational structures in Sales may limit long-term base salary increases.
       </li>
       <li>
        Performance incentives, which are not included in the dataset, likely account for untracked variation in departments like Sales.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
       Recommendations
      </h2>
      <p>
       The data makes it clear that salary growth is more dependent on where you work than how long you've worked. Departments operate under different compensation dynamics, and employees who understand these patterns can better navigate their career paths.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         For Employees:
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Focus on strategic department moves, skill development, and performance visibility rather than relying solely on tenure. For example, moving from Sales to HR may offer more structured salary progression.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         For HR and Leadership:
        </strong>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Redesign compensation frameworks to reflect role complexity and career advancement, not just experience.
         </li>
         <li>
          Implement transparent pay bands and set clear expectations around salary potential within departments.
         </li>
         <li>
          Use predictive models not as final salary calculators, but as internal tools to flag disparities and missed growth opportunities.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
       Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
       This case study challenges the conventional belief that experience naturally leads to higher pay. The evidence shows that salary growth is uneven, nonlinear, and largely shaped by departmental role rather than tenure. While HR offers more stable growth and IT attracts early-career talent, Sales appears structurally flat in base compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For career-driven employees, this means shifting the focus from accumulating years to making intentional moves, targeting growth-oriented roles, and staying adaptive. For organizations, it’s a call to design data-driven, equitable salary structures that reward both contribution and capability—not just time.
