                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <p>This case study investigates the performance of ad campaigns for an online retailer specializing in consumer goods, focusing on fitness tracker products. Using SQL for business intelligence, the analysis identifies top-performing ad types and product categories that maximize Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). Key findings reveal the most profitable product and ad type combinations, providing actionable insights for optimizing ad spending and refining campaign strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>The retailer seeks to optimize ad spending across various product categories and ad types to achieve higher ROAS and more efficient budget allocation. By analyzing historical ad campaign data, the retailer can identify which ad types and products yield the best performance, enabling data-driven decisions for future campaigns.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p><strong>Data Collection & Preparation:</strong> The dataset includes ad campaign details such as product category, ad type, total ad spend, click-through rate (CTR), and ROAS. This data was organized for efficient SQL querying and analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Descriptive Analytics:</strong> SQL was used to aggregate ROAS by product category and ad type, and to compute key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CTR, total ad spend, and conversion rate for each campaign.</p>
                    <p><strong>Customer Segmentation & Performance Metrics:</strong> The data was segmented by ad type and product, allowing for an in-depth analysis of which segments generated the highest ROAS. Individual product performance was assessed by ROAS to identify the most effective ad strategies by product category.</p>
