                    <p>Uncovering Category Preferences to Drive Targeted Marketing</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This case study examines gender-based spending patterns to help the marketing team create more targeted and effective campaigns. While overall spending is similar between male and female customers, distinct category-level differences offer valuable insights for refining promotions, messaging, and product placement to boost engagement and drive sales.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Customer Distribution</h2>
                    <p>The dataset reveals a nearly even split between genders, with 69 female customers (51.11%) and 66 male customers (48.89%). This balanced distribution ensures that the findings reflect representative customer behavior and are not skewed by unequal sample sizes. It provides a reliable foundation for comparing purchasing patterns across genders.</p>

                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Overall Average Spending</h2>
                    <p>Female customers spend an average of $290.45, while male customers spend $274.64. Although women appear to spend slightly more, the difference of $15.81 is not statistically significant (p = 0.497). This suggests that, at an overall level, spending behavior does not differ meaningfully by gender. Marketers should therefore look beyond total spending when developing targeted strategies.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Overall Quantity Purchased</h2>
                    <p>The quantity of products purchased per transaction is also nearly identical between genders. Female customers average 5.51 items, while male customers average 5.48. The p-value of 0.963 confirms that this difference is statistically insignificant. Both male and female customers tend to purchase a similar number of items, indicating comparable transaction sizes.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Spending and Contribution by Product Category</h2>
                    <p>When spending is broken down by product category, some clear patterns emerge. Among female customers, the highest share of spending goes to snacks ($4,788.91 or 23.90%), followed by dairy and vegetables. Male customers allocate the largest share of their spending to vegetables ($4,386.05 or 23.36%), beverages, and fruits.</p>
                    <p>These findings suggest distinct category preferences. Women are more inclined toward snacks, while men show a stronger preference for beverages and vegetables. Dairy and vegetables, however, remain popular among both genders, making them suitable for broad-based marketing efforts.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Statistical Significance of Category Spending Differences</h2>
                    <p>Most of the observed differences in category-level spending are not statistically significant. Categories such as bakery, beverages, dairy, fruits, and vegetables all have p-values greater than 0.05, indicating no meaningful gender-based variation. The exception is snacks, which show a statistically significant difference in spending between genders (p = 0.018). Female customers spend significantly more on snacks, making this category a prime candidate for gender-targeted promotions.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Confidence Intervals for Spending and Quantity</h2>
                    <p>Confidence intervals further reinforce the conclusion that overall spending and purchase quantities are similar across genders. The 95% confidence interval for male spending ranges from $242.36 to $306.92, while for females it ranges from $257.19 to $323.72. These ranges overlap substantially, confirming no significant difference (p = 0.497). Similarly, quantity intervals overlap for males (4.84 to 6.13 units) and females (4.80 to 6.21 units), with a p-value of 0.963. These results validate the earlier findings and shift the focus to category-level insights for actionable marketing opportunities.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
                    <p>While overall spending and quantity purchased are similar between genders, clear differences in category preferences support gender-specific marketing strategies. Female customers spend significantly more on snacks, making this a strong candidate for targeted campaigns emphasizing indulgence, convenience, and lifestyle appeal. Male customers show greater interest in beverages and vegetables, suggesting marketing efforts that highlight performance, value, and health benefits.</p>
                    <p>To capitalize on these insights, snack promotions should be placed in lifestyle-themed areas and use visually appealing packaging. Beverage promotions for men can focus on multi-pack deals and placement near ready meals or fitness products, while vegetable marketing should feature recipe kits, pre-cut options, and simple health messaging. Tailoring campaigns to these patterns can enhance engagement, drive targeted sales, and improve marketing ROI.</p>
