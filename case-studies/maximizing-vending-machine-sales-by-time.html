                                <li>Drinks such as Irish whiskey, chocolate, mocha chip, caramel with chocolate, and double latte have very low frequencies, especially in the evening.</li>

                    <h2>Goals Alignment:</h2>
                    <p>The primary business goals are to increase sales, optimize vending operations, and improve restocking efficiency based on actual consumption patterns. The results directly align with these goals by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Optimizing Sales:</strong> Identifying peak sales periods helps in timing promotions and restocking effectively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improving Operational Efficiency:</strong> By knowing the most and least popular drinks during different times, operations can focus on stocking the right products, minimizing waste, and ensuring high-demand items are always available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maximizing Promotions:</strong> Understanding which time windows generate the most revenue or volume allows for targeted marketing campaigns, ensuring that the right products are promoted at the right times.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Impact:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> The afternoon is the highest-revenue period, suggesting that targeted volume promotions, such as discounts or combo offers, can be more effective during this time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency in Restocking:</strong> By focusing on popular drinks like Americano and Latte during their peak times, restocking schedules can be aligned with customer preferences, reducing the chances of stockouts or overstocking low-performing items.</li>
                        <li><strong>Marketing Effectiveness:</strong> Tailoring promotions to the specific time of day can drive higher engagement and conversions, leading to more successful campaigns and better customer satisfaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Interpretation:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Time-of-Day Variations:</strong> The variation in revenue and product popularity across different times of day indicates different customer preferences and purchasing behaviors. The afternoon, with its high revenue, may benefit from volume-based promotions, while the morning, where AOV is higher, may respond better to premium offers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Product Preferences:</strong> The consistent popularity of Americano, Latte, and Café Latte across all time periods highlights these drinks as customer favorites. These drinks should be emphasized in promotions and restocking schedules to cater to ongoing demand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low-Performing Drinks:</strong> The low frequency of sales for drinks like Irish whiskey and double latte suggests that these items either have niche appeal or suffer from low customer awareness. Offering limited-time discounts or marketing these drinks during slower hours might increase their visibility and sales.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Contextual Factors:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Customer Behavior:</strong> The observed popularity of Americano and Latte across time periods is likely due to their general popularity as staple coffee drinks. The drop-off in sales for certain items during the evening may reflect a shift in customer preferences for lighter or more indulgent drinks, such as those typically consumed in the evening.</li>
                        <li><strong>Promotional Impact:</strong> The variations in drink popularity suggest that customer preferences might be influenced by the time of day (e.g., a preference for strong coffee in the morning and lighter options like Latte in the afternoon). This could be factored into targeted promotional strategies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Recommendation:</h2>
                    <p>The analysis reveals clear opportunities to optimize sales, marketing, and restocking strategies. By leveraging time-of-day preferences and focusing on both high-demand and underperforming products, the business can drive sales while improving operational efficiency.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Targeted Promotions:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Promote premium drinks like Americano and Café Latte with offers such as “Morning Espresso Kick.” This could leverage the high AOV in the morning.</li>
                                <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Focus on volume-based promotions, such as “Latte Lounge Hour,” to take advantage of the peak revenue period.</li>
                                <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Encourage sales of evening-appropriate drinks through offers like “Smooth Latte Wind-Down” for lighter beverages.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Restocking Strategy:</strong> Focus on high-demand drinks like Americano and Latte, especially during their peak hours (morning and afternoon). Ensure that stock levels are aligned with demand patterns to avoid waste or stockouts, particularly during high-volume periods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Address Low-Performing Products:</strong> Consider running limited-time offers for low-performing drinks such as Irish whiskey, mocha chip, and double latte. Alternatively, explore reformulating these drinks or removing them from the menu if they continue to underperform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Experiment with Low-Sales Hours:</strong> Use the evening period to experiment with introducing new drinks or offering exclusive promotions to boost sales during slower times. Targeting these hours with strategic promotions could increase visibility for low-performing drinks and generate additional revenue.</li>
                    </ul>
