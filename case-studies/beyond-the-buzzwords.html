                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Jewelry marketers today can’t afford to guess which keywords will perform. This case study analyzes what’s actually working across Facebook Ads, DV360, and Google Ads—revealing which search terms attract consistent clicks, which ones are gaining momentum, and which are costing money without delivering results.</p>
                    <p>The goal is simple: help marketers focus on the most effective keywords and platforms to drive more traffic and sales. From reliable performers like Minimalistic Jewelry to emerging opportunities like Everyday Jewelry, this report offers practical guidance to build smarter, more profitable campaigns.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Which Keywords You Can Count On Week After Week</h2>
                    <p>When running ads week after week, stability matters. Minimalistic Jewelry and Multi-strand Necklaces showed consistent interest over time, with no major drop-offs. These are great candidates for always-on campaigns that require dependable performance.</p>
                    <p>Charm Bracelets had some strong weeks but was less consistent, while Baroque Jewelry and Colorful Jewelry were unpredictable—performing well early on, then trailing off. These keywords may need more careful timing or targeting to avoid wasting spend.</p>

                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Which Keywords Are Taking Off—and Which Are Falling Behind</h2>
                    <p>Several keywords are gaining momentum fast. Colorful Jewelry saw a 625% jump in engagement, and Minimalistic Jewelry and Charm Bracelets followed with strong spikes. These trends suggest rising interest and should be prioritized in upcoming campaigns.</p>
                    <p>On the flip side, Baroque Jewelry showed a steep drop after an early high. If you're still investing in this term, it may be time to pause or refresh the messaging.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Which Keywords Show the Strongest Growth Patterns Over Time</h2>
                    <p>Looking at weekly performance patterns, Minimalistic Jewelry and Multi-strand Necklaces stayed consistent with modest, reliable results. Colorful Jewelry built up interest over time, peaking toward year-end—ideal for seasonal pushes.</p>
                    <p>Baroque Jewelry stood out at first but quickly declined. Charm Bracelets came and went in bursts. These keywords may work best in short, time-limited promotions.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>What to Promote on Weekdays vs. Weekends</h2>
                    <p>Timing matters. Vintage and Artisan Jewelry consistently perform better on weekdays. If you're promoting elegant, classic styles, keep them in front of weekday shoppers.</p>
                    <p>By contrast, Layered and Boho Jewelry see more action on weekends. These fun, relaxed styles pair well with Friday–Sunday promotions and influencer-led weekend content.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>What’s Getting Views But Not Clicks—And What To Fix</h2>
                    <p>Baroque Jewelry and Formal Jewelry had strong visibility but weak engagement. Despite being shown often, shoppers weren’t clicking. That’s a sign your creative or targeting needs work—or it's time to shift focus entirely.</p>
                    <p>Even Minimalistic Jewelry, usually a solid performer, showed signs of fatigue after a strong run. If performance slips, test new visuals or copy before pulling the plug.</p>

                    <h2>Which Keywords Work Best on Facebook, DV360, and Google Ads</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On DV360, Animal Jewelry led the pack, followed by Cocktail Rings and Festival Jewelry. These bold, visual styles do well in high-impact display formats.</li>
                        <li>On Facebook Ads, Fall Jewelry, Body Jewelry, and Midi Rings performed best—great for lifestyle storytelling and seasonal content.</li>

                    <h2>Where Your Ad Spend Pays Off the Most</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Facebook Ads delivered the highest returns, especially for Fall Jewelry (ROAS 34.88) and Body Jewelry (ROAS 32.20).</li>
                        <li>DV360 followed, with strong performance from Animal and Festival Jewelry.</li>
                        <li>Google Ads offered moderate returns, especially for niche, product-focused keywords like Nature-Inspired and Mixed Metal Jewelry.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you're spending broadly across platforms, it’s time to refine. Invest where the returns are proven.</p>
