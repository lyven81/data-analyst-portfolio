                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <p>This case study examines how retail businesses can use predictive modeling to identify high-spending customers. Using a logistic regression model, the study analyzes customer demographics and purchasing patterns to predict which customers are likely to spend over $1,000. The findings offer actionable insights for targeting high-value customers through personalized promotions, loyalty programs, and marketing campaigns.</p>

                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>Retailers face challenges in identifying high-spending customers who can be targeted for promotions and loyalty programs. This case study aims to predict high spenders using customer demographic data and purchasing behavior, helping businesses optimize their marketing strategies and improve revenue.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p><strong>Dataset:</strong> The dataset, titled "Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Dataset," includes attributes like age, gender, product category, and total amount spent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analytic Framework:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logistic regression was used to predict high spenders based on age, gender, and product preferences. SQL queries were employed to analyze spending behavior.</li>
                        <li>The logistic regression model was trained using customer demographic and purchasing data, achieving high precision and accuracy. The model predicted whether a customer would spend more than $1,000 based on input features such as gender, age group, and product category.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>ROC Curve and Model Performance</h3>
                    <p>One of the key ways we measure how well a model can predict outcomes is through something called the ROC Curve. This curve helps us see how well the model balances between identifying true positives (correct predictions) and avoiding false positives (incorrect predictions).</p>
                    <p>The AUC score (Area Under the Curve) tells us how accurate the model is. A perfect score is 1.0, and that's exactly what our model achieved, meaning it's making perfect predictions. This level of performance means the model can confidently and accurately distinguish between different customer groups.</p>
