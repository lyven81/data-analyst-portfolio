                    <p>How Marketing Can Drive More Hotel Bookings</p>
                </header>

                <section>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This report was prepared for the marketing team to understand why so many searches do not turn into bookings. The main challenge is that while people are actively looking for travel options, only a small share complete the booking process.</p>
                    <p>The analysis looks at who is more likely to book, where drop-offs happen, and what factors influence decisions. The goal is to help the marketing team focus campaigns on the right customers, reduce booking barriers, and turn more searches into confirmed sales.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Question 1: Who Converts?</h2>
                    <img alt="Device Type Conversion Analysis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q1 conversion_rate_device_type.png"/>
                    <img alt="Group Size Conversion Analysis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q1 conversion_rate_group_size.png"/>
                    <img alt="Family Trip Conversion Analysis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q1 conversion_rate_is_family_trip.png"/>
                    <img alt="Package Booking Conversion Analysis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q1 conversion_rate_is_package.png"/>
                    <p>Desktop users convert more often than mobile users, with booking rates of 8.3% versus 6.0%. Group size also matters. Solo and couple travelers convert at 7–12%, while certain large groups—like groups of 9 or 12—reach 14–15%.</p>
                    <p>Trip type and booking type add another layer: non-family trips (8.2%) and standalone stays (9.3%) perform better than family trips (7.1%) and packages (4.1%). In short, conversions are strongest among desktop users booking standalone stays, often solo or in pairs, and on non-family trips.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Question 2: Where Do Drop-Offs Happen?</h2>
                    <img alt="Desktop Funnel Drop-off Analysis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q2 funnel_dropoff_device_desktop.png"/>
                    <img alt="Mobile Funnel Drop-off Analysis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q2 funnel_dropoff_device_mobile.png"/>
                    <p>The biggest drop-off is between searches and bookings. On desktop, nearly 90,000 searches lead to only 8,000 bookings. On mobile, the gap is even wider—13,500 searches result in just over 1,000 bookings.</p>
                    <p>This shows that while many people browse on mobile, fewer complete their booking there. The main loss happens at the final step of the funnel, with mobile users facing more friction, possibly due to usability, trust, or payment issues.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Question 3: What Levers Matter Most?</h2>
                    <img alt="Logistic Regression Coefficients" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q3 logistic_regression_coefficients.png"/>
                    <p>The regression analysis shows that booking type and device are the strongest levers. Package bookings and mobile usage both lower the chance of conversion. Other factors like longer stays and larger groups have a small positive effect, while lead time and distance show little impact.</p>
                    <p>This means that improving mobile usability and simplifying package bookings will likely have the biggest payoff for raising conversions.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Question 4: How to Prioritize Campaigns?</h2>
                    <img alt="Device Type Campaign Prioritization" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q4 campaign_prioritization_device_type.png"/>
                    <img alt="Group Size Campaign Prioritization" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q4 campaign_prioritization_group_size.png"/>
                    <img alt="Family Trip Campaign Prioritization" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q4 campaign_prioritization_is_family_trip.png"/>
                    <img alt="Package Booking Campaign Prioritization" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/from-clicks-to-check-ins/Q4 campaign_prioritization_is_package.png"/>
                    <p>Desktop continues to lead in both volume and conversion, making it a safe anchor for campaigns. Solo travelers convert the most at around 12%, but pairs account for the largest number of searches with only moderate conversion.</p>
                    <p>Non-family trips and standalone stays combine high conversion with high volume, making them easy wins. Meanwhile, family trips and packages show lower conversion but could be improved with the right incentives.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Question 5: Who Is More Likely to Convert?</h2>
                    <p>Looking ahead, the decision tree shows that some groups have the highest potential to convert. These include travelers planning longer stays of 3–5 nights, booking 2–8 weeks ahead, and traveling solo or as a pair.</p>
                    <p>This profile points to customers with stronger intent and a greater chance of turning searches into bookings if campaigns target them directly.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Question 6: How Can We Create Targeted Campaigns?</h2>
                    <p>Campaigns should focus on the solo and couple travelers identified above. Messaging should highlight reassurance and value—such as flexible cancellation and immersive trip experiences.</p>
                    <p>Channels should fit behavior: desktop ads and emails for those likely to book on computers, and mobile reminders 2–4 weeks before travel for planners still deciding. Offers should include time-limited discounts and extras like free breakfast or local tours, which appeal to longer-stay travelers.</p>
                    <p>By reducing friction and rewarding early commitment, campaigns can convert these high-intent groups more efficiently.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The analysis shows that while search activity is strong, too many searches stop short of a booking—especially on mobile. The customers most likely to convert are desktop users booking standalone stays, traveling solo or as couples, with longer stays planned in advance.</p>
                    <p>Barriers such as mobile friction, package complexity, and weaker family performance remain key obstacles.</p>

                    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve mobile booking flows to reduce drop-offs at the final step.</li>
                        <li>Simplify package bookings by making them clearer and more flexible.</li>
                        <li>Target high-potential personas—solo and couple travelers booking longer stays 2–8 weeks out—with tailored campaigns.</li>
                        <li>Prioritize couples as a growth segment, nudging them with discounts or reminders.</li>
                        <li>Sustain desktop as the booking anchor, using ads and emails to close the loop on searches started elsewhere.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In short, the way forward is to cut friction on mobile and package bookings, sustain strong desktop performance, and invest in campaigns that push high-intent personas over the line from search to booking.</p>
