       Study Context
      </h2>
      <p>
       This probability analysis examines the likelihood of motorcyclists being involved in road accidents in Malaysia, specifically from 2000 to 2021. The dataset is sourced from the Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) and Department of Statistics Malaysia, providing a comprehensive view of actual crimes, deaths, and injuries across different types of road users. The analysis is focused on motorcyclists, who are disproportionately represented in road accidents compared to other road users.

      <h2>
       Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
       The study seeks to quantify the risk faced by motorcyclists in road accidents, highlighting their significant involvement in both fatal and non-fatal incidents. The findings are crucial for insurance companies, government policymakers, and public safety organizations to understand the extent of risk motorcyclists face and how this information can be used to improve safety measures, insurance pricing, and infrastructure development. By estimating the probability of motorcyclists being involved in accidents, businesses can make more informed decisions about policy adjustments, investment in safety programs, and insurance premiums.

       Key Questions
      </h2>
      <h3>
       1. What is the probability that a motorcyclist will be involved in a road accident?
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Motorcyclists account for 49.9% of all road accidents in Malaysia, making them the highest-risk group for insurers and policy makers. This is shown in the bar chart and pie chart, confirming the dominance of motorcyclists in accident statistics.
       </li>
       <li>
        Motorcyclists should be classified as a high-risk group for insurance underwriting. Policies should reflect this elevated exposure with tailored coverage and higher premiums.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <img alt="Bar Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/motorcyclist-accident/chart%201%20-%20bar%20chart.png"/>
      <h3>
       2. Is the probability of fatal or injury-related outcomes for motorcyclists higher than for other road users?
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Injury rate for motorcyclists stands at 84.5%, the highest among all user groups, while the fatality rate is 15.5%.
       </li>
       <li>
        Insurers should offer products with comprehensive medical coverage and quick payout structures due to the high frequency of injuries in motorcyclist accidents.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <img alt="Stacked Bar Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/motorcyclist-accident/chart%202%20-%20stacked%20bar%20chart.png"/>
      <h3>
       3. How does motorcycle accident probability vary by year?
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        From 2000 to 2014, the probability of motorcyclists being involved in accidents remained consistently high at 0.53-0.59. A sharp drop in 2015-2019 is likely due to data inconsistencies.
       </li>
       <li>
        Insurers should rely on 2000-2014 data for risk modeling while being cautious about the post-2015 data, which may be unreliable.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <img alt="Line Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/motorcyclist-accident/chart%203%20-%20line%20chart.png"/>
      <h3>
       4. Are accident trends for motorcyclists improving or worsening over time?
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Accident trends from 2004 to 2015 show a steady downward decline, with incidents falling from 39,000 in 2004 to under 2,000 in 2015.
       </li>
       <li>
        If this downward trend is confirmed, insurers may consider lowering premiums and focusing on severity mitigation over frequency management.
       </li>
      </ul>

       Goals Alignment
      </h2>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Revenue Growth:
        </strong>
        By identifying motorcyclists as high-risk, insurers can offer higher premiums while diversifying offerings with specific coverage options.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Cost Reduction:
        </strong>
        The study helps identify the impact of injury rates on claims management and fraud detection. The decline in accidents suggests that resource allocation can shift from frequency management to severity control.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Customer Retention:
        </strong>
        By offering comprehensive coverage to motorcyclists, insurers can improve customer satisfaction and retain policyholders, especially in the high-risk segments.

       Data Interpretation
      </h2>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Motorcyclists as a High-Risk Group:
        </strong>
        Motorcyclists represent the largest share of road accidents in Malaysia. The high injury rate (84.5%) among motorcyclists indicates that even non-fatal accidents often result in significant harm, leading to higher claim volumes for insurers.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Data Inconsistencies in Recent Years:
        </strong>
        The sharp drop in accidents in 2015-2019 suggests data quality issues, which should be taken into consideration when making forecasts or pricing decisions based on recent trends.
       </li>

       Contextual Factors
      </h2>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Urbanization and Infrastructure:
        </strong>
        Urban areas with better infrastructure and traffic laws tend to report more accurate data and safer environments for motorcyclists, while rural areas might have underreported incidents.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h2>
       Recommendation
      </h2>
      <p>
       Given the findings that motorcyclists face a significantly higher risk of accidents, especially injuries, insurers should adopt a segmented pricing model that reflects this risk. The evidence suggests that the historical decline in accidents is statistically significant and should be used to adjust long-term premiums.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Increase Premiums for Motorcyclists:
        </strong>
        Motorcyclists should be categorized as a high-risk segment in the insurance market. Premiums should reflect the higher probability of accidents and injuries.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Offer Specialized Coverage Options:
        </strong>
        Insurers should create customized policies for motorcyclists, such as hospitalization riders, accidental death benefits, and frequent claim discounts to cater to their higher risk profile.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Invest in Risk Reduction Initiatives:
        </strong>
        Insurers should collaborate with government agencies and NGOs to fund public awareness campaigns and safety programs, such as subsidized protective gear and rider education.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </section>

      <h2>
       Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
       Motorcyclists represent the highest-risk group in Malaysia’s road accident landscape. While the fatality rate is moderate, their injury rate is significantly high, making them a key concern for insurers and safety authorities. The long-term trend shows a steady decline in accidents, but the post-2015 data may be skewed by reporting inconsistencies. Based on the findings, insurers should adopt segmented premiums for motorcyclists, develop specialized coverage, and invest in risk-reducing initiatives to improve safety and reduce overall claims. Additionally, businesses and policymakers should focus on improving motorcycle safety and infrastructure to continue driving down risk exposure in this high-risk group.
