          <h2>Study Context</h2>
          <p>This analysis examines the stability and volatility of fuel prices (RON95, RON97, and Diesel) in Malaysia from April 2017 to April 2025. The data, sourced from the Ministry of Finance, represents weekly retail prices for these fuel types. The Automatic Pricing Mechanism (APM), introduced in 2017, is used by the government to adjust retail fuel prices based on global crude oil prices. This dataset reflects both market-driven prices and government interventions, allowing for an evaluation of pricing behaviors and potential risks for businesses and policymakers.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Data Interpretation</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>RON97’s volatility can be attributed to its lack of government regulation and its direct exposure to global crude oil prices. This contrasts with RON95, which benefits from subsidies that stabilize its pricing, thus making it more predictable.</li>
            <li>Price outliers in RON97 are tied to global oil market fluctuations and political disruptions (e.g., the Russia-Ukraine conflict), which have caused significant price surges.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Contextual Factors</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Government Policy:</strong> The subsidization of RON95 has been a major stabilizing force. Policy changes could lead to higher volatility, particularly in the middle-income sector, which benefits from the subsidy.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Market Trends:</strong> International oil price movements have a direct impact on RON97 pricing, explaining the observed volatility.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Recommendation</h2>
          <p>Based on these findings, businesses in fuel-dependent sectors should focus on risk mitigation strategies, including fuel price hedging and alternative energy sources, especially when dealing with RON97’s price fluctuations.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimize Fuel Price Strategy:</strong> Businesses relying on RON95 should prepare for future price fluctuations by investing in long-term pricing contracts. Those using RON97 should develop flexible pricing models to adapt to higher volatility.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Investment in Alternative Energy:</strong> Consider investments in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure or renewable energy solutions to reduce dependency on volatile fuel prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust Consumer Pricing:</strong> Retailers and transportation companies should implement dynamic pricing strategies to offset higher fuel costs, ensuring long-term sustainability.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The analysis highlights that RON97 shows the highest volatility, driven by global market factors, whereas RON95 remains stable due to government subsidies. If subsidies are removed or restructured, RON95 prices could experience greater fluctuations, potentially disrupting businesses that rely on fuel price stability. For businesses and consumers in Malaysia, this analysis provides valuable insights into future fuel pricing trends, enabling better risk management and more strategic investment decisions in energy and infrastructure. By considering these findings, businesses can prepare for potential disruptions and ensure they continue to meet consumer demand while mitigating the financial impact of fluctuating fuel prices.</p>
