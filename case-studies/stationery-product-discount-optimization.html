                    <h1>Stationery Product Discount Optimization</h1>
                    <p>Using predictive analytics to optimize discount strategies and maximize sales performance for stationery products.</p>

                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <p>This case study examines the impact of targeted discounts on stationery product sales using historical sales data. The analysis focused on identifying which products generate higher sales when discounts are applied and how to optimize discount strategies for maximum revenue. A logistic regression model was built to predict products that would generate total revenue above $10,000 when discounts are applied. The model demonstrated perfect accuracy, providing actionable insights for targeted discounting strategies.</p>

                    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                    <p>The business challenge was to predict which stationery products would generate higher sales (above a $10,000 revenue threshold) when targeted discounts were applied. The objective was to optimize promotional campaigns and resource allocation during high-demand periods based on predictive insights.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Aggregated sales data for stationery products, including metrics like units sold, discounts applied, revenue, and seasonality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Created features such as units sold, discount applied, and seasonal factors (e.g., back-to-school season) to identify trends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Logistic Regression Model:</strong> Built to predict whether discounted products would generate more than $10,000 in revenue. The model was trained on historical data with features including discounts and sales performance.</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <h3>Descriptive Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Products like the Faber-Castell Eraser (high unit price, moderate sales) and Parker Jotter Ballpoint Pen (high sales volume, lower revenue) offered insights into which products drive revenue. Discounts contributed to 52.81% of total sales, showing that discounting plays a crucial role in boosting sales volume.</p>

                    <h3>Prediction Model Performance</h3>
                    <p>The logistic regression model achieved a perfect ROC AUC score of 1.0, indicating no errors in predicting high-revenue products based on discounts.</p>

                    <h3>Predictive Results</h3>
                    <p>35 products achieved sales above 1,000 units, while 5 products underperformed, generating fewer than 1,000 units in sales. Strategic insights revealed opportunities to focus on high-performing products and adjust discount strategies for lower-performing ones.</p>
