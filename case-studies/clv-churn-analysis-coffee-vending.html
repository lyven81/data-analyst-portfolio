                        <li><strong>Top 10 Customers by Predicted CLV:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The highest predicted CLV is $3,662.98, with the 10th customer having a CLV of approximately $370.94. These high-CLV customers represent valuable targets for loyalty or premium campaigns.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Customers are segmented into 4 tiers based on their average spending:</li>
                                <li>Tier 4 shows the highest average spend of $2,259.01, standing out from the other tiers.</li>
                                <li>Tiers 1 and 2 show minimal spending, indicating opportunities for upselling or targeted promotions.</li>
                                <li>Tier 3 shows moderate spending and could be a focus for nurturing into higher value tiers.</li>
                                <li><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/clc-churn-analysis-coffee/Chart%202%20Customer%20Segmentation%20by%20Average%20Spending.png" alt="Chart 2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>High Frequency, Low Spenders:</strong> There is a strong positive correlation between frequency and spending, but there are some customers with high frequency but low spend. These customers are potential candidates for bundle offers or incentives to increase spending per transaction.
                            <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/clc-churn-analysis-coffee/Chart%203%20Spend%20Increases%20with%20Frequency.png" alt="Chart 3" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></li>
                        <li><strong>Recent but Low Frequency Customers:</strong> Many recent buyers exhibit low frequency, indicating they are new customers who could be nurtured with onboarding campaigns or welcome offers to increase frequency and spending.
                            <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/clc-churn-analysis-coffee/Chart%204%20Are%20recent%20buyers%20frequent%20buyers%20too.png" alt="Chart 4" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></li>
                        <li><strong>Churn Risks Among High-Value Customers:</strong> Some previously high-value customers have not made recent purchases. These customers have a high CLV but are likely at risk of churning. Prioritizing them for reactivation campaigns is crucial to prevent losing this valuable group.
                            <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyven81/data-analyst-portfolio/main/images/clc-churn-analysis-coffee/Chart%205%20Are%20High-Value%20Customers%20Also%20Loyal%20Customers_.png" alt="Chart 5" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></li>
                        <li><strong>Behavioral Patterns Linked to High CLV:</strong> Tier 4 customers, who exhibit low recency and high frequency demonstrate that recent, frequent, and high-spending behaviors are correlated with higher CLV. These customers are ideal candidates for VIP loyalty programs.

                    <h2>Goals Alignment:</h2>
                    <p>The analysis directly supports several business goals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Customer Retention:</strong> By identifying churn risks and high-value customers, the business can prioritize retention efforts and design loyalty programs for the most valuable segments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Targeting customers based on their CLV and segmenting them into value tiers will enable more effective promotional strategies, increasing overall spending and lifetime value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Understanding the distribution of spending and frequency allows the business to tailor product offerings and stock machines with the most popular items, reducing waste and optimizing inventory management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Marketing Optimization:</strong> Identifying key behavioral patterns linked to high CLV will help the marketing team design personalized campaigns that appeal to high-value customers and potential upsell opportunities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Impact:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Targeted Marketing:</strong> The segmentation of customers into different CLV tiers allows for tailored marketing campaigns that are more likely to resonate with customers and drive revenue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Churn Prevention:</strong> Identifying at-risk high-value customers and targeting them for reactivation can prevent revenue loss and maintain long-term customer relationships.</li>
                        <li><strong>Optimized Product Offerings:</strong> By understanding which customers are high-frequency but low-spenders, the company can create targeted offers or bundles to increase per-transaction revenue.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Data Interpretation:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High CLV Customers:</strong> The high-CLV customers, such as those in Tier 4, demonstrate behaviors that are conducive to long-term value, including frequent purchases and significant monetary contributions. These customers are the backbone of revenue, and their behaviors should be replicated across the broader customer base.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> The customer base can be divided into distinct segments, with Tier 4 being the most valuable. These customers have a balance of recent activity, high frequency, and significant spending, which makes them ideal candidates for loyalty programs and premium offerings. On the other hand, Tiers 1 and 2 may require targeted promotions to drive spending and increase engagement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frequency vs. Spend:</strong> The positive correlation between frequency and spending suggests that increasing the frequency of purchases can directly impact the total spend. High-frequency but low-spending customers may need targeted incentives to increase their spending per transaction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Churn Risk and Reactivation:</strong> Customers with high CLV but low recency are at risk of churning, and preemptive reactivation campaigns should be designed to encourage them to return. This aligns with the business’s goal of reducing churn and maintaining long-term relationships with high-value customers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Contextual Factors:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Customer Behavior:</strong> Seasonal variations in product demand and changing customer preferences could impact CLV. For instance, customers may purchase more during specific times of year (holidays or sales), influencing their overall lifetime value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Promotions Impact:</strong> Previous promotions, loyalty rewards, or changes in pricing could influence customer behavior and purchasing patterns, affecting both recency and frequency of purchases.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
                    <p>The business can leverage the insights from customer segmentation and CLV analysis to implement more targeted, data-driven strategies. By focusing on retaining high-value customers, reducing churn, and optimizing product offerings, the company can enhance its profitability and customer loyalty.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>VIP Loyalty Programs:</strong><br>Introduce a VIP program for customers in Tier 4 with high CLV, offering exclusive rewards or discounts to encourage continued engagement and deepen their relationship with the brand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Targeted Upselling Campaigns:</strong><br>For high-frequency, low-spending customers, develop bundle offers or upselling incentives aimed at increasing their spend per transaction. These could include loyalty points for spending above a certain threshold or discounted combo offers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Churn Prevention and Reactivation:</strong><br>Focus on customers with high CLV but low recency for reactivation campaigns. These customers should be prioritized for personalized offers to encourage them to return and continue their relationship with the company.</li>
                        <li><strong>Product Optimization and Inventory Management:</strong><br>Use the customer segmentation data to optimize the product offerings in vending machines. Ensure that high-demand drinks are always available, while reducing waste by phasing out low-performing items.</li>
                        <li><strong>Behavioral Analysis for Campaigns:</strong><br>Use the insights into the behaviors linked to high CLV (e.g., recent purchases, high frequency, and high spending) to design future marketing campaigns. Replicate these behaviors across other customer segments to boost overall CLV.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
