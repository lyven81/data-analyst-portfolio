                    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <p>This case study analyzes the beverage sales performance across different store locations during key events, such as Chinese New Year, using both descriptive and predictive analytics. The analysis revealed that certain beverages, particularly Spritzer 1.5L, consistently perform well during high-demand periods. By employing a linear regression model, we can forecast future sales and adjust inventory and promotional strategies to meet anticipated demand spikes. The predictive model was evaluated, resulting in an average prediction error (RMSE) of 276.51, demonstrating reasonable accuracy for forecasting sales.</p>
